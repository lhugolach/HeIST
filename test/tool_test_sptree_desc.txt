The test species tree is not drawn to scale. Nodes are labelled with the timing of the split in 4N generations. Each tip is labelled with 3 values: the taxon ID, the character state 
for that taxon (0 for ancestral, 1 for derived), and the sampling time of the taxon relative to the longest branch (taxon 4).
